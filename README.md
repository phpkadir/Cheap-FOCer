## Advantages
- All functional features of VESC 4.12

- Lower build and BOM cost

- TO-220 FETs allow for big heat sink attachment for better thermal performance

- SMD components no smaller than 0805 make hand assembly practical

- Added ON/OFF capability to turn off control circuitry when controller is not in use. A simple mechanical switch will achieve this when connected to the “ON/OFF” 2-pin header.

- Can fit in typical “350W” ebike enclosures

- Can fit in Hammond 1590b enclosures

## Disadvantages (that I know of)

- Larger than original VESC. Cheap FOCer is 45mm x 92mm

- Higher profile with TO-220 package FETs

- Additional assembly steps to beef up high-current traces. 2 layers of 1oz copper can’t handle the current flowing through during operation. Assembler will have to apply wire/solder wick/bus bar to the exposed Power, Ground, and Phase traces that you can see in the images.

## Warning
- Issues may be present with VESC firmware 3.50 and above. Recommended to use firmware versions before 3.5

## Software/Firmware Requirements

Cheap FOCer is based on the VESC 4.12 and uses the relavent VESC firmware/software.
